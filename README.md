# Sorting-Algorithms
#Description
The code base implemented the following sorts: Brute Force Bubble, Flagged Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Shell, Heap, Merge, and Quick.
Used command line arguments to get the total number of records to sort. This will become n.
Create and randomly fill an array with integers. Use this same array of data for each sorting algorithm. Make sure to reset the array(s) back to the original data after each sort so that you are comparing the algorithms on the same data set.
Measure the time it takes for each sort to complete its sorting routine. Write the sort name and the time it took to complete to the screen as well as a file.
Use C-Arrays (native arrays), vector class, and your array class as containers.
Output for this program does not need to be printed out. However, run the program and store the results in a text file in the solution.
